# simple_CNNs

Simple CNN blocks for easier re-use of small parts for when importing a full model isn't viable (anywhere people throw in a VGG or ResNet blindly). Originally I was going to do ResNet block -> DenseNet block -> ConvNext block to scale up design complexity and performance but the design of the ConvNext is basically as simple as the ResNet's if not even simpler, so I'll just focus on it.

ConvNext v1 and not v2.
